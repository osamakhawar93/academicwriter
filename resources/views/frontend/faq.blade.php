						<h4 class="accordion-toggle">1. There are a lot of writing services on the internet. How do I know TheMidterm is for real?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								We have been in the custom academic writing business for nearly a full decade. We would not have stayed in business very long if we were not the best at what we do. Please review our client comments to see what people say about us…and you’ll see why we’re consistently ranked #1 among our competitors by The National Board of Professional Scholastic Writers.


							</p>
						</div>
						
						<h4 class="accordion-toggle">2. Will your writing get me an “A” on my assignment?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								Our professional subject matter experts are dedicated to providing you with the very best work product as per your grade level and project requirements. That said, we cannot guarantee any particular academic outcome. You are the sole judge of our work. Third party reactions (friends, family, professors) are beyond our control, but we guarantee your project will fulfill your project requirements and that we’ll do all we can to exceed your expectations.


							</p>
						</div>
						
						<h4 class="accordion-toggle">3. Where are your writers located?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								The majority of YourAcademicWriter custom academic writers are based in the U.S. Others work out of Australia, England, and Canada. They’re all native English speakers and hold advanced degrees from elite institutions.
							</p>
						</div>
						<h4 class="accordion-toggle">4. I need a research paper in a very specific subject area. Will your writers be knowledgeable about my topic?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								The writer assigned to your project will very likely hold a graduate degree in your specific subject area, and may have already spent years researching and writing about it. That gives you a great advantage, because your writer knows exactly what your professor is looking for in your project.


							</p>
						</div>
						
						<h4 class="accordion-toggle">5. What if someone finds out I’m not writing my paper myself?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								The only way that will happen is if you reveal that information. When you register with TheMidterm, any information you give us is held in strictest confidence. We value your privacy greatly and never share anything with third parties. Please see our privacy policy for further details.


							</p>
						</div>
						
						<h4 class="accordion-toggle">6. What about copyright issues?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								When we deliver your completed project to you, you become the author of record with full copyright assigned to you. There is absolutely no identification of your project with YourAcademicWriter, and once you’ve paid us, we do not retain, store, or archive your project materials on our servers. You simply place your name on the cover page, and you own everything that follows. We will never resell, publish online or in print, or disseminate in any way your copyrighted work.


							</p>
						</div>
						<h4 class="accordion-toggle">7. What about plagiarism? My school checks for that.</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								We never copy, edit, transcribe, or replicate in any way prior written work, regardless of its source. All projects delivered to you are carefully pre-screened using proprietary plagiarism software. This allows us to guarantee that all work delivered is completely original and unique. Your academic reputation depends on it…and our professional reputation depends on it.
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<h4 class="accordion-toggle">8. You charge more than a lot of other websites. Why?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								Because we’re simply better. Our competitors employ off-shore “writers” for whom English is a 2nd or 3rd language, and who will work for less than a subsistence wage. Much of what other websites deliver comes from “paper mill” digital content that is plagiarized from random websites. You may receive a completed document, but handing it in to your professor will likely create more problems than you have ever imagined. Our writers are professionals with serious academic backgrounds. We value their skills and their commitment to our clients’ success, and we compensate them accordingly. As in much of life, you get what you pay for; paying what appears to be a “bargain” rate is always more expensive in the long run.
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<h4 class="accordion-toggle">9. How does your “value pricing” work?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								Our pricing is determined by an objective industry standard determined by the number of double-spaced pages written. Where special formatting is provided (Table of Contents, charts, illustrations, graphs, indexes, bibliographies), total page count may be impacted with adjusted pricing.


							</p>
						</div>
						<h4 class="accordion-toggle">10. Do you guarantee your writing quality?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								YourAcademicWriter provides the following rock-solid guarantees:
										<ul>
											<li>Superior research and writing on any subject</li>
											<li>Direct communication with your assigned writer</li>
											<li>Absolute confidentiality</li>
											<li>100% plagiarism free work</li>
											<li>Your copyrighted ownership of the completed work</li>
											<li>Delivery within your specified deadline</li>
											<li>The format and citation style of your choice</li>

											<li>24/7 customer service</li>
											<li>Personal online portal access to your project</li>
										</ul>
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<h4 class="accordion-toggle">11. What subject areas can you write about?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								There are no subject areas outside the expertise of our professional academic writers. Liberal Arts, Economics, Social Studies, Physical Sciences, Health Sciences, Law, Business, Political Science...to name a few. Complex Mathematics and subjects requiring substantial computational work are handled on a case-by-case basis and may incur an additional charge, i.e.: post-graduate engineering, telemetry, organic chemistry treatises, etc.


							</p>
						</div>
						
						<h4 class="accordion-toggle">12. I’m a Ph.D. candidate. Can you provide research and writing at that level?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								The majority of our professional writers hold graduate and professional degrees in a wide range of academic disciplines. The writer assigned to your project will be well qualified—and has probably taught at the graduate level—in your subject area. We have an impeccable reputation for providing thesis and dissertations that find their way into renowned academic publications.
							</p>
						</div>

This writing process is intense and time-sensitive; you may request updates on progress throughout on your account Dashboard
